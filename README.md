# bikeshare-capstone-data
data for bike sharing capstone


Data made available by Motivate Inc. for google analytics capstone project as part of the Google Analytics Certificate Program on Coursera. 

Data originally downloaded from https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html and taken for prior 12 months at the time of the project, which includes July 2022-July 2023

This is my first repo on github and I am trying to put the data in a place in CSV format so that I can pull it into my R Markdown file. 

It is possible that this is not the most efficient way to accomplish this task. 

If you see this and have thoughts, reach out and I'd be happy to chat about it.
